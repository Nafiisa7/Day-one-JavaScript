# 100 Days of Code - Day 1

Today marks the start of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**! ðŸŽ‰  

## Day 1 Highlights
- **What I did**:
  - Practiced JavaScript basics: variables, data types, template literals, operators, and conditional statements.

## My Code
Here is the code I worked on today:
```javascript
let name = "Nafiisa";
console.log(`Welcome to JavaScript, ${name}!`);
